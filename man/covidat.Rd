\title{covidat: COVID-19 reporting data from Mexico City (2020-2022)}
\format{
A data frame.
}
\usage{
data(covidat)
}
\description{
Surveillance count data provided by the Mexico City's Health Ministry
at https://datos.cdmx.gob.mx/dataset/base-covid-sinave. Data comes
from the National System of Epidemiologic Surveillance (SINAVE) and
corresponds to the update of January 9th 2024, 12:35 (UTC-05:00). The
dataset includes all confirmed COVID-19 cases registered in the city.
The original dataset was aggregated and pre-processed as described in the
note below.
}
\details{
This is count data with each row representing case counts. The columns are as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{date_of_registry}: date when the report was registered on the database.
\item \code{date_of_symptom_onset}: date when the patient reported symptoms started.
\item \code{sex}: biological sex (either male or female)
\item \code{n}: the case count of individuals within those dates for each sex
}
}
\note{
Dates are provided as present in the dataset and contain errors.
Theoretically no individual should have a \code{date_of_symptom_onset} after
their \code{date_of_registry}; however the database does contain cases like that
which are close to what practitioners find in the wild.
