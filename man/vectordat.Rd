\format{
A data frame.

\usage{
data(vectordat)

\description{
Surveillance count data provided by Mexico's General Directorate
of Epidemiology (Direccion General de Epidemiologia)
at https://www.gob.mx/cms/uploads/attachment/file/965318/Datos_abiertos_historicos_etv_2024.pdf.
Data comes from the National System of Epidemiologic Surveillance (SINAVE)
and was downloaded on May 30th 2025. The dataset includes all suspected
vector-borne disease cases for the states of Veracruz, Guerrero and Tabasco.
The original dataset was aggregated and pre-processed.
}
\details{
This is count data with each row representing case counts. The columns are as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{update}: date when the report was first registered on the database.
\item \code{symptoms}: date when the patient reported symptoms started.
\item \code{sex}: biological sex (either male or female)
\item \code{n}: the case count of individuals within those dates for each sex
\item \code{state}: state where the report was originated
}
}
\note{
Dates are provided as present in the dataset and contain errors.
Theoretically no individual should have an \code{update} after
their \code{symptoms}; however the database does contain cases like that
which are close to what practitioners find in the wild.
